        <h5>First Five - Year Plan for the</h5>
        <p>To penetrate the general line for the transition period, the 
        Party and the government has enacted the First Five - Year Plan for the

        countries on agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist industry and 
        commerce establish a combination of socialist transformation, i.e., "a 
        Sangai".The socialist transformation and socialist construction, which 
        has the character of the Soviet Union to help China's construction of 
        the 156 projects as the center 694 large and medium - sized projects, 
        focused on heavy industry, the establishment of the socialist 
        industrialization of China, on a preliminary basis.Through the first 
        five - year, China has preliminarily established an independent 
        industrial system, the socialist industrialization.</p>
        <h5>the period of the Second</h5>
        <p>During the First Five - Year Plan achievements recorded by 
        the central and local leaders had developed a lot of complacency, has 
        exaggerated the extent of animus and subjectively and acting to the 
        detriment of economic law, the socialist construction of the long - 
        term, complexity, had been seriously underestimated, resulting in the 
        occurrence of the Great Leap Forward, the communes,Big steel - like 
        motion.</p>
        <p>: the Great Leap Forward from 1958 to 1960, the Communist 
        Party of China, a country - wide of the line of Ultra "Left" motion, the
        Communist Party and its Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central 
        Committee continuously after 1956 and error criticized the opposition to
        rash advance on the basis of the poor peasants, is the "Left" rash 
        advance product.</p>
        <p>Big steel - making: 1958 on Aug. 17, the general secretary of
        the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee held the enlarged 
        meeting of the Political Bureau in Beidaihe, through "the whole party 
        and all the production approximately 10.7 million tons of steel, and 
        struggle", and raised an astounding national big steel - 
        making.Universal steel - making movement of manpower, materials and 
        waste, has been severely undermined by agriculture, the Ministry of 
        Light Industries and other causes and impact, the national economy 
        disproportionately, seriously affecting the lives of the people, and 
        dampen the enthusiasm of the masses, are formed which could impair the 
        production of "The proneness to boasting and exaggeration".</p>
        <p>Commune: on July 1, 1958 the first in the nation to the 
        founding of the People's Commune.Movements of the rural education, 
        medical, welfare and welfare, large water conservancy construction, 
        township enterprises, agricultural technology, rural business, the 
        militias and national defense facilities construction are relatively new
        in the early founding of the People's Republic of China has been a 
        qualitative leap and change, and food and clothing for the people to 
        constantly become richer.But because the farmers gained is not directly 
        proportional to his personal effort, so - called "egalitarianism" of 
        ethos, someone calls the equalitarian peasants production enthusiasm is 
        not high, to a certain degree of agricultural production is limited.</p>
        <h5>The principle of</h5>
