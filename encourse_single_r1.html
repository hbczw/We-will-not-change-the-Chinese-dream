        <p>The importance of China-ASEAN cooperation has transcended the bilateral scope and has increasingly become the support and engine for maintaining regional peace and stability and promoting regional common prosperity. In recent years, China has always regarded ASEAN as a priority for neighboring diplomacy and firmly developed friendly cooperation with ASEAN. With the advancement of the “Belt and Road” construction, China also needs to strengthen its docking with ASEAN development. Sub-regional cooperation mechanisms such as cooperation have also developed rapidly in recent years. These developments urgently require us to make the "peak meeting" mechanism bigger, stronger, and better.</p>

        <p>This year coincides with the 15th anniversary of the establishment of China-ASEAN strategic partnership, which is also the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Summit. The 15 years of "peaks" have both success and regularity, as well as opportunities and challenges. The "peak meeting" must closely follow the national development strategy, take advantage of the trend, follow the trend, and change with the trend, in order to continuously inject new impetus into its own development. The next development idea of the “Four Summit” is to closely focus on the “One Belt and One Road”, the construction of the Sino-Singapore interconnection and the southward channel construction, and the “Southward, Northern Union, Dongrong and Xihe” of Guangxi, facing the new international and domestic development pattern.

        <p>Do strong trade. It is to promote "trade" with "peak". Organizing major economic and trade activities is an important starting point for the "peak meeting" to implement the major development strategies of the country and the autonomous region. Formulate a service plan for the “One Belt, One Road” southward channel construction, and actively connect the services to promote key projects and work.
