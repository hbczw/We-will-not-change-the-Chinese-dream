    <h6 class="title-h2">Celebrating the 19th National Congress, playing the Guangxi notes of the main theme of "Win-Win Cooperation"</h6>
    <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         <p>Bring into play the unique advantages of Guangxi and ASEAN countries, accelerate the open development of the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone and the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Belt, build an international channel for ASEAN, and create a new strategic fulcrum for the opening and development of the southwestern central and southern regions, forming a 21st century maritime silk. The important gateway between the road and the Silk Road Economic Belt. If such a pattern can be formed, Guangxi will develop this game of chess.</p>

<h6 class="title">1. Only go all out, the mission is not insulting -General Secretary Xi Jinping participated in the Third Session of the 12th National People's Congress and gave Guangxi the "Three Major Positions" New Mission during the Guangxi delegation's deliberation</h6>

<p>On September 28 this year, the China-Singapore Southbound Interchange Sea-rail Intermodal Normal Train (Guangxi Beibu Gulf Port-Chongqing) achieved two-way separation for the first time. One day later, the Lancang Railway, which was completed in 9 years, was operated across the board. The train from Gansu officially joined the sea-rail combined transport artery.</p>

<p>This not only indicates the official opening of the Sino-Singapore interconnection southward channel, but also declares that Guangxi, which has the most convenient seaport in western China, has organically linked the “Belt and Road” and implemented the “three major positionings” to take another solid step.</p>

<p>As an important part of China-Singapore's third intergovernmental cooperation project, the Sino-Singapore (Chongqing) Strategic Interconnection Demonstration Project, the southbound channel uses various modes of transportation such as railway, highway, water transport, and aviation. Through Guiyang and Nanning, it will reach the main logistics nodes of Singapore and ASEAN through the coastal ports along the coast of Guangxi, and connect the Central European and Central European routes to Central Asia and Europe to form the first north-south freight passage and the complete international land and sea. The trade circle has achieved a seamless connection between the Silk Road Economic Belt, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and the Yangtze River Economic Belt.</p>

<h6 class="title">2. Spreading the wings for Dapeng -Forming an efficient and convenient transportation network connecting Shangxiang, Xiongtong, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, connecting “Shuitiegong” and docking ASEAN</h6>

<p>How to practice the "three major positioning", especially the construction of an important gateway for the "One Belt, One Road" organic connection, as the only province in China adjacent to the ASEAN land and sea, has been looking for effective hands.</p>

<p>For a long time, most of the goods in western China have gone through the east-west passage to the sea, and they have traveled to most of China's coastline to reach Southeast Asia. Compared with the Yangtze River shipping channel from Shanghai to Singapore, the southbound channel is shortened by about 2,100 kilometers, the transportation time is reduced by about 15 days, the railway two-way freight rate is reduced by 30%, and the port operation rate is reduced by 50%. The irresistible charm highlights the huge market value and potential.</p>

<p>Therefore, when the South-South channel initiative was launched, Guangxi was keenly seized the opportunity and took the initiative to go to the relevant state ministries and commissions to negotiate and negotiate with the brother provinces. It was strongly supported and promoted by the Chinese and New Zealand countries and regions, and only for more than half a year. The southward channel that has been hailed as the "international spiritual canal" has turned from a blueprint to a reality.</p>

<p>If the "Belt and Road" is likened to the two wings of the Asian take-off, then the interconnection is the bloodline of the two wings. At the 2014 APEC meeting in Beijing, General Secretary Xi Jinping had such a metaphor.</p>

<p>High-speed county and county, high-speed railway city, civil aviation film, and inland rivers and rivers - for Dapeng to spread the wings and dredge the meridian, these years Guangxi accelerated the outbound sea out of the provincial channel construction, focus on the formation of Shanglian Xiaoxiang It is connected to Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao, connecting “Water and Water Public” and connecting to ASEAN's efficient and convenient transportation network.</p>

<p>From the "road network end" to the "regional hub", the Guangxi Railway has achieved a gorgeous turn. Today, Guangxi high-speed railway accounts for about 10% of the country's total mileage. Since 2013, the railway passenger traffic volume has been ranked first in the country. 12 of the 14 districts and cities have opened high-speed trains, initially forming a center with Nanning. "12310" high-speed rail economic circle.</p>

<p>"The further improvement of the Guangxi high-speed rail network not only facilitates the domestic people, but also greatly promotes the tourism cooperation between China and ASEAN." Ma Hansong, director of the passenger transportation department of the Nanning Railway Bureau, told reporters that tourists from Vietnam and other ASEAN countries entered the country from Guangxi. After that, you can take a train to travel to any province around Guangxi.</p>

<p>In order to better play the important role of the organic link "One Belt, One Road", Guangxi adheres to the "two legs" walk: one is land, and strives to open the high-speed railway from Guiyang to Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou and Urumqi to the north. The construction of the large-scale land passage of China Unicom's Central South Peninsula provides transportation support for the construction of the China-Indochina Economic Cooperation Corridor; one is the sea route, focusing on the construction of the Beibu Gulf Regional International Shipping Center, the Regional International Trade Logistics Financial Cooperation Center, and the Port City Cooperation Network. Smooth trade with countries along the Maritime Silk Road.</p>

<p>At present, the main border cities of Guangxi adjacent to ASEAN have access to expressways, and Nanning and Guilin airports have opened 23 routes with 9 countries in ASEAN. Guangxi Beibu Gulf Port has established maritime transportation with 47 ports in 7 ASEAN countries. The number of regular container foreign trade liners is 29, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeds 200 million tons, and the annual container throughput capacity is 4.68 million TEU.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of the “Belt and Road Initiative”, Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group and Singapore International Port Group jointly operate container terminals, and participate in the Kuantan Port of Malaysia to take over the container terminal of the Port of Brunei, to help the development. All the way along the line countries to improve the port management and operation level. "Now, 'beibu' has become the local spoken language of Mora Port, referring to the Guangxi Beibu Gulf Port. This shows that we have achieved good reputation in the local area and laid a good foundation for further deepening the cooperation between the two sides." Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group Chairman Zhou Xiaoxi said.</p>

<p>To build an international channel, not only the southeast and northwest will be "communicated" in all directions, but also all kinds of transportation networks in the sea and land. Guangxi is actively promoting the construction of a three-dimensional transportation system between Jianghai, Tiehai and Luhang, and opening up “capillary vessels” to achieve seamless connection. </p>

<h6 class="title">3. Build a new four-dimensional four-edge pattern -Accelerate the expansion of new open space for domestic and international cooperation in serving national strategy</h6>

<p>Guangxi, which has the originating port of the ancient Maritime Silk Road, is rejuvenated in the new century.</p>

<p>Autumn in September. With the success of the 14th China-ASEAN Expo and the Business and Investment Summit, the scope of the East Expo has expanded from the China-ASEAN “10+1” to the regional comprehensive economic partnership “10+6” and even larger regions. It has become an effective public platform for enhancing political mutual trust and promoting economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchanges. At present, the import and export of Guangxi and ASEAN is growing at an average annual rate of 23.1%, accounting for 57.9% of all imports and exports, ranking 13th in the country and first in the west.</p>

<p>Coastal along the Yangtze River, connecting China and ASEAN two vast markets, is the most convenient sea passage in southwest China, and an important land and sea passage for ASEAN countries to enter the Chinese market. Based on this unique location advantage, our district will build a new pattern of “four-dimensional support and four-link linkage”, vigorously implement the strategy of opening up, and accelerate the expansion of new open and cooperative space for domestic and international in serving the national strategy.</p>

<p>The potential of the "sea" has been released. Continuously innovate the open development mechanism and mechanism of the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone, and strive to improve the regional comprehensive strength and core competitiveness. According to statistics, since the establishment of the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone, the GDP has increased by 3.1 times, fiscal revenue has increased by 4.5 times, and total import and export has increased by 8 times. The Beibu Gulf Economic Zone has jumped to the leading position of Guangxi's opening up and cooperation.</p>

<p>The vitality of "Jiang" is fully stimulated. Grasping the Pearl River-Xijiang Economic Belt as an opportunity for national strategy, moving closer to advanced productive forces, connecting with neighboring provinces, optimizing industrial layout, and strengthening cooperation in ecological construction and environmental protection. In 2013-2016, the region's investment attraction reached 2.44 trillion yuan. Yuan, an average annual increase of 10.2%.</p>

<p>The article on "Bian" is solid enough. In the port opening, border trade, personnel exchanges, customs clearance and other aspects of the substantive steps, last year, the region's processing trade exceeded 10 billion US dollars, doubled in 2013, the first in the western region of China to build and operate international trade " Single window".</p>

<p>Open development played the strong sound of the times. The "Three Major Positions" opened a new window for Guangxi's deep participation and integration into the "Belt and Road" construction.</p>

<p>On the one hand, Guangxi continues to deepen international cooperation with a focus on ASEAN, and actively participates in multi-regional cooperation such as the Pan-Beibu Gulf, the Greater Mekong Sub-region, and the Lancang-Mekong River, and accelerates the promotion of China-Malaysia “Double Parks” and China-Indonesia Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone. The construction of the park, the China-Vietnam cross-border economic cooperation zone, China and Brunei Yulin Health Industrial Park, and a large number of projects signed into the park. During the “Twelfth Five-Year Plan” period, Guangxi’s foreign trade import and export maintained rapid growth. In 2016, the import and export volume of the whole region increased by 12.9% annually, 14.1 percentage points higher than the national total. The border trade volume ranked first among the border provinces and regions in China. Bit.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Guangxi has comprehensively expanded domestic regional cooperation. The special experimental zone for cooperation between Guangdong and Guangxi is the only inter-provincial cooperation pilot zone across the east and west of China and has become a new “investment land”. Actively promote the establishment of the Guiguang, Nanguang, Yungui high-speed rail economic belt and the Guangdong-Guizhou-China high-speed rail economic zone cooperation pilot zone, as well as the inter-provincial poverty alleviation cooperative industrial park and the Guizhou-Guizhou-Guizhou national cultural tourism zone. Yongzhou, Hunan and Guilin, Guangxi have opened a new path for tourism cooperation in the Xianggui City Circle.</p>

<p>Under the background of the “Belt and Road” construction, Guangxi has accelerated the “going out” pace and deepened the international capacity cooperation, which has also given birth to the confidence of local enterprises to the world.</p>

<p>In the 10 years of “going out”, Guangxi Jianong Yi’an Company has signed a total of over 7 billion yuan of overseas business contracts, becoming the spokesperson of “China Standard”; with the construction of the China-Laos Railway last year, the loading of Guangxi Liugong Group Machines and excavators are favored by various subcontractors of the project. With this model, Liugong has expanded its business to Pakistan, Bangladesh and other countries; Guangxi Electric Power Industry Survey and Design Institute under the Guangxi Hydropower Engineering Bureau, and Guangdong Hydropower Second Bureau Limited The company’s first contracted Vietnam’s first green hydropower station, the Zhanhua Hydropower Station, has an annual generating capacity of 200 million kWh...</p>

<p>“Guangxi state-owned enterprises that go global” have developed from simple import and export trade to investment, joint ventures, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, foreign contracted projects, and strategic alliances. The investment field has expanded to industrial and mineral resources development. In terms of utilization and infrastructure construction, the investment area is mainly from Hong Kong and ASEAN countries, and continues to expand to Europe and Africa.” Zeng Guangan, chairman of Liugong Group, said.</p>
