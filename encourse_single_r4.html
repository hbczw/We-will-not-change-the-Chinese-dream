    <h6 class="title-h2">China expands its opening to the outside world to achieve win-win cooperation</h6>
    <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         <p>On June 21, 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with the heads of well-known multinational corporations who came to China to attend the Special Roundtable Summit of the Global CEO Committee and exchanged views with them. President Xi Jinping reiterated China's firm determination to expand opening up and open up a shared global governance concept, and gave the world a "reassuring" to show China's open and inclusive big country.</p>

        <p>The past 40 years have been China’s 40 years of continuous reform and opening up.</p>

        <p>40 years ago, Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and opening up, led China's initiative to open the country. Since then, China's opening up to the outside world has continued to deepen, and joined the WTO in 2001, further integrating into the world market and economic globalization, and achieving rapid economic development. In the past 40 years, China’s GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 9.5% in terms of comparable prices. In dollar terms, China’s foreign trade has grown at an average annual rate of 14.5%. China has grown into the world's second largest economy with a total GDP of over $10 trillion and the world's largest trader of goods.</p>

        <p>Now, China is already one of the largest markets in the world, with merchandise imports accounting for about one-tenth of the world. China has also become an important foreign investor. In 2016, foreign investment reached US$170 billion. Although it fell to US$120 billion in 2017, it is still at a high level. At present, China's economy is steadily advancing, and the steady development trend is consolidating, driving imports to continue to grow rapidly, foreign investment remains active, and it has made important contributions to promoting global economic growth. In recent years, China has contributed more than 30% to world economic growth.</p>

        <p>At present, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and opening up a new journey has been opened up.</p>

        <p>In order to promote high-quality economic development, China in the new era must take the initiative to open its doors, achieve new breakthroughs in opening up, and embrace the world's development trend with a more open attitude. President Xi Jinping said at the Davos World Economic Forum in 2017 that "China's door is always open to the world and will not be closed. Opening the door, the world can enter China, and China can go to the world."</p>

        <p>President Xi Jinping further pointed out in the report of the 19th National Congress that openness brings progress and closure is bound to lag behind; China’s open door will not be closed, and it will only grow wider. Promoting the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening is an important part of China's implementation of the new development concept and the construction of a modern economic system.</p>

        <p>To expand opening up to the outside world, China is not just talking about it, but taking tangible actions.</p>

        <p>In April this year, President Xi announced in the opening speech of the Boao Forum for Asia a series of measures to expand China's opening up, including substantially relaxing market access, creating a more attractive investment environment, strengthening intellectual property protection, and actively expanding imports. And stressed that "it will be brought to the ground as soon as possible, should be sooner rather than later, should not be slower", indicating the path for China to open a new situation of opening up to the outside world.</p>

        <p>In the same month, President Xi Jinping announced at the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the provincial special economic zone in Hainan that the party Central Committee decided to support the construction of a free trade pilot zone in Hainan Island, support Hainan to gradually explore and steadily promote the construction of free trade ports with Chinese characteristics, step by step and phased Establish a free trade port policy and institutional system. These major initiatives clearly show that China, after 40 years of reform and opening up, has a broader mindset of open cooperation and opportunity sharing.</p>

        <p>"Opening up to the outside world is a key move for China's development." "In the past 40 years, China's economic development has been achieved under open conditions. In the future, China's economy must achieve high-quality development under more open conditions." "One Belt, One Road" It is not closed, but open and inclusive; it is not a solo of a Chinese family, but a chorus of countries along the line.” President Xi Jinping’s speech at this roundtable summit will further expand the new era of opening up and make it clear. China’s clear-cut attitude to the world’s all-round opening has sent a clear signal that China is willing to share opportunities, develop together, and win-win cooperation with all countries in the world. It once again demonstrates the firm confidence and determination of China’s reforms without stopping and opening up.</p>

        <p>In the future, as China builds a well-off society and moves toward socialist modernization, domestic consumption will continue to escalate, the level of industrial development will steadily increase, and domestic demand will grow steadily. Both consumer goods and investment products and foreign investment have huge growth potential. China will continue to share development opportunities with countries around the world, actively expand imports, and actively invest abroad, providing new impetus to the development of the world economy. In the next five years, the scale of China's merchandise imports is expected to reach 8 trillion US dollars, and the amount of foreign investment and foreign investment is expected to reach 600 billion US dollars and 750 billion US dollars respectively. This has provided tremendous opportunities for cooperation and win-win for all parties involved in multinational companies in China.</p>

        <p>In November this year, the first China International Import Expo will be held in Shanghai. This is a major decision for China to promote a new round of high-level opening up. It is a major initiative for China to open its market to the world and will build an important public platform for global trade development. It will further promote China's supply-side structural reforms, thereby injecting confidence and positive energy into the development of the world economy.</p>
