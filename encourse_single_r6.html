    <h6 class="title-h2">“One Belt, One Road” aims to achieve mutual benefit and not “economic plunder”</h6>
    <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         <p> In the past five years, the “Belt and Road Initiative” initiative has achieved remarkable achievements. However, discordant sounds also appear. Some of them have called the “Belt and Road” initiative “Plunder Economics”, which is surprising.</p>
        <p>The author believes that the “Belt and Road Initiative” is vastly different from economic plunder in many fields, even diametrically opposed. In other words, the “Belt and Road Initiative” is essentially different from economic plunder. This difference is mainly reflected in the following aspects.</p>
        <p>The first is that the motivation is different. The purpose of China's implementation of the “Belt and Road Initiative” is to establish closer economic and trade ties between China and Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe, and to seek more in-depth cooperation and broader development space, and to promote regional development through export of funds and technology. With prosperity, it will promote the upgrading and rebalancing of the regional economy. The purpose of economic plunder is to make economic resources flow out of the looted areas through the advantages of their own strength. In other words, the purpose of economic plunder is to seize economic resources rather than win-win cooperation.</p>
        <p>Second is the difference in philosophy. China has become Asia's most important growth pole, and Asia's geopolitical landscape has entered a new historical stage. China proposes to use the concept of "pro, sincerity, benefit, and tolerance" to deal with the surrounding relationship, emphasize the balanced development of justice and profit, and expand the "Chinese Dream" in China into the "Asia-Pacific Dream", seeking to look at the gains and losses in a more long-term perspective. . In the final analysis, ideas and values are more vital and disseminative than policies at a certain time, and the penetration of social forces is far-reaching. In order to continue to promote regional integration and consolidate the foundation of regional security, Chinese leaders have proposed the “One Belt, One Road” program, actively supporting infrastructure construction and interconnection projects in the region, and deepening bilateral mutually beneficial cooperation on a larger scale and larger industrial scale. Continue to enhance the voice of Asian countries in global affairs and issue a unique voice of Asian countries in developing the economy and maintaining social stability. Chairman Xi Jinping said at the UN Headquarters in Geneva on January 18, 2017: "Building a community of human destiny and achieving win-win sharing." He added: "I propose the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative to achieve a win-win and shared development." "One Belt, One Road" is inseparable from the "community of human destiny". The idea of economic plunder is to plunder the degree of external dependence of countries and regions through capital, market, technology, etc., and to prolong the predation behavior. The difference in the concept of the two is huge, and obviously cannot be generalized.</p>
        <p>China's economic and trade investment with countries along the “Belt and Road” has become increasingly close, cooperation has progressed well, policy communication, facilities are connected, trade is smooth, capital finance, and people's hearts have achieved positive results. More and more countries have taken the initiative to take the “Belt and Road” initiative. Express shares the Chinese development dividend. Specifically, China has strengthened communication and consultation with relevant countries along the route, and has promoted a number of mature conditions in areas such as infrastructure interconnection, industrial investment, resource development, economic and trade cooperation, financial cooperation, humanities exchange, ecological protection, and maritime cooperation. Key cooperation projects. China actively carries out the planning and construction of the Asian Highway Network and the Trans-Asian Railway Network, and has opened 13 highways and 8 railways with Northeast Asia, Central Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asian countries. In addition, infrastructure construction such as oil and gas pipelines, cross-border bridges, transmission lines, and optical cable transmission systems have yielded results. The construction of these facilities has laid a solid material foundation for the “Belt and Road”. The means of economic plundering is quite different. In history, there are four main ways in which the powers can plunder China: controlling trade ports; depriving tariff autonomy; dumping goods and capital output; and manipulating the economic lifeline. In essence, the “Belt and Road” has increased the hematopoietic function of the economies of the countries along the line, while the economic plunder is just the opposite – only the lack of hematopoietic function can form a dependence on developed countries.</p>
        <p>Finally, the effect is different. The current achievements of the “Belt and Road Initiative” are remarkable. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, in the first half of 2018, Chinese companies increased their investment in 55 countries along the “Belt and Road”, totaling US$7.4 billion, up 12% year-on-year. The contract value of newly signed foreign contracted projects with the countries along the “Belt and Road” was US$477.9, accounting for 44.8% of the total amount for the same period; the completed turnover was US$38.95 billion, accounting for 53.5% of the total. By promoting infrastructure interconnection, facilitating trade and investment facilitation, industrial docking integration, and scientific and technological cooperation, China's cooperation with countries along the “Belt and Road” has continuously advanced to a new level, which is not only becoming a key force for promoting global economic recovery, but also effective. Activated the economic potential of the Eurasian region. As of the first half of 2018, China has established 82 overseas economic and trade cooperation zones in 24 countries along the “Belt and Road”, with an additional investment of 2.59 billion US dollars, accounting for 87% of the total new investment in China's overseas economic and trade cooperation zones; 300 million US dollars, accounting for 71.4%. Liu Xiangdong, an associate researcher at the Economic Research Department of the China International Economic Exchange Center, said in an interview with the International Business Daily that the continued growth of China’s trade and investment along the “Belt and Road” countries has supported the recovery of global trade growth to a certain extent, especially Against the background of the growing protectionism of trade protection, the steady advancement of the “Belt and Road Initiative” will become an important supporting force for resisting trade protection. In the later period, as China's economy shifts to consumption-driven and actively expands imports, the “One Belt, One Road” initiative will contribute more and more to international trade. After China and the EU reached the "Belt and Road" construction docking, bilateral trade accounted for a further increase in the proportion of their respective foreign trade. Among them, bilateral trade in goods reached a new high, and service trade showed a rapid development momentum. According to the statistics of the People's Daily, as of the end of June 2018, the cumulative number of flights in China and Europe has exceeded 9,000, with nearly 800,000 TEUs of goods, 48 domestically operated cities, and 42 cities in 14 countries in Europe. The scale and normalization of the China-European class has made the “Belt and Road” a new economic link connecting China and Central and Eastern Europe. Li Tianguo, assistant researcher at the Institute of Asia-Pacific and Global Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the infrastructure sector has long been a major bottleneck hindering Asian economic development, and the “Belt and Road” can help China and related countries to achieve more in building infrastructure. More consensus. As China and Asian countries establish and improve bilateral and multilateral economic and trade cooperation mechanisms under the “Belt and Road” project, and continue to achieve new results in trade and investment facilitation, interconnection and capacity cooperation, Asian economic development will certainly be obtained from it. Stronger growth momentum. The economic plunder will cause long-term poverty and backwardness in the plundered countries and regions, and the economy will not develop. What benefits from it is only the western developed countries that carry out predatory behavior. In this regard, the “Belt and Road Initiative” is very different from economic plunder.</p>
        <p>In summary, the “Belt and Road Initiative” is completely different from the economic plunder, and the two are even opposite in many respects. To regard the "Belt and Road" initiative as an economic plunder is not an ulterior motive, or a lack of minimum political and economic common sense.</p>
