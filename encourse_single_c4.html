    <h6 class="title-h2">"Guangxi Picture Book" shows the national customs and stunning "One Belt, One Road" Summit Forum</h6>
    <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         <p>Under the drums, the cute dolls built the "wind and rain bridge" in their hearts. In the sun, the beautiful girls sang happily on the waterwheel; in the hot sun, the industrious father, grandma and Azi are working hard. Sowing... During the “One Belt, One Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum, the dance poem “侗”, directed by the famous director Zhang Jigang and performed at the Liuzhou Art Theater in Guangxi, showed a rich ethnic customs to Chinese and foreign friends at the Beijing Tianqiao Art Center. "Guangxi Picture Book".</p>

        <p>From May 12th to 13th, the "One Belt, One Road" International Cooperation Summit Forum arranged four cultural performances, and the dance poem "tong" is one of them.</p>

        <p>On the evening of May 13, the News Center of the Summit Forum organized more than 50 journalists from the countries along the “Belt and Road” to come to the Beijing Tianqiao Art Center to watch the dance poem “tong”.</p>

        <p>"Peruvian newspaper" reporter Julio, after reading "tong", repeatedly praised: "I have heard of Liuzhou before, but I have never been to Liuzhou. Such a perfect dance performance, let me have a national style of Liuzhou and The city has a deeper understanding of the city."</p>

        <p>Liu Kang, dean of Liuzhou Art Theatre, told reporters that the performance of the dance poem "tong" to Beijing is also the top priority of the third round of the national tour of Liuzhou's outstanding stage repertoire this year.</p>

        <p>Since the launch of this round of tour, the theater has not only organized cultural performances, but also carried out urban propaganda around the theme of “Spring Flowers and Autumn Water”. On the one hand, the “Quanhua Qiushui·Painting Liuzhou” urban propaganda video was incorporated into the performance; on the other hand, the Liuzhou City Publicity Exhibition Area was set up in various theaters.</p>

        <p>The reporter saw at the scene that the Liuzhou City Exhibition Area, which was set up in the lobby of the Beijing Tianqiao Art Center, attracted many audiences and Beijing residents to stop by. The ever-changing panorama of Liuzhou, the solid industrial development, the cultural and spiritual architecture of the Jinfeifei, the colorful cultural activities, and the passionate water sports have made everyone re-recognize the new Liuzhou and New Guangxi.</p>

        <p>“Chunhua Qiushui·Painting Liuzhou” city propaganda short film, around the two themes of “Spring Blossom” and “Qiu Shui”, vividly introduced Liuzhou to today in a very beautiful way.</p>

        <p>Jiao Yaoguang, deputy mayor of Liuzhou City, said that since the country proposed the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, Liuzhou’s cultural development has seized opportunities, integrated in advance, and served the overall situation. Through the implementation of cultural “going out”, we actively integrate into the “Belt and Road” construction.</p>

        <p>This year, Liuzhou further accelerated the pace of the construction of the “One Belt, One Road” for cultural services, strengthened the radiation belts of major cultural industry projects, and actively explored the effective forms and working carriers of the “cultural +” industry. In January, the dance poem "侗" was successfully performed in two consecutive performances at the Singapore Xingyu Performing Arts Center. Many Singaporean politicians and more than 6,000 local audiences deeply felt and understood the customs, history and culture of the Sanjiang Dai people in Liuzhou.</p>

        <p>"In the future, we will organize a dance poem "tong" to tour the ASEAN countries, and Liuzhou will introduce more exciting foreign performance projects. In recent years, Liuzhou has not only promoted the boutique culture project 'going out', but also cultivated vocational education for the ASEAN countries. A lot of talents." Jiao Yaoguang said.</p>

        <p>Liuzhou vigorously promotes the culture of “going out”, which is a wonderful demonstration of Guangxi's promotion of the people's hearts in the construction of the “Belt and Road”. The leaders of the autonomous regional government attending the “Belt and Road” summit said that Guangxi actively exerts its unique advantages of proximity to ASEAN, humanities and relatives, and frequent exchanges, and continues to promote cultural exchanges with countries along the “Belt and Road” with ASEAN as the focus. Culturally, Guangxi held the China-ASEAN Drama Week and other cultural events, and has formed the China-ASEAN Cultural Industry Forum, the Nanning International Folk Song Art Festival, and the China-ASEAN International Rally.</p>
