    <h6 class="title-h2">Inspiration from the governance of the country since the 18th National Congress: Adhere to cooperation and win-win, promote peaceful development</h6>
    <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         <p>The historical events will reflect the era of human development and progress. When the reform and opening up of China is deeply integrated with the world of great development, great changes, and adjustment, what kind of future will be opened for mankind?</p>

         <p>"Set the world in the right place, the road to the world." Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has coordinated the two major domestic and international situations, grasped the general trend of world development, unswervingly promoted the diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics, and created a peaceful international environment and a good surrounding environment for China’s development. Solving human problems, contributing to China's wisdom, providing China's programs, and stimulating the majestic power of peaceful development. Five years of cooperation and win-win, five years of hard work, China has never been to the center of the world stage, the Chinese dream and the world's dreams are closely connected and complement each other.</p>

         <p>The diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics highlights the charm of the Chinese concept. In the past five years, General Secretary Xi Jinping has profoundly thought about the future and destiny of mankind and the development trend of China and the world, actively promoted diplomatic theory and practice innovation, and proposed a series of new ideas, new ideas and new strategies. In order to adhere to peaceful development as a strategic choice, to seek cooperation and win-win as the basic principle, to build partnership as the main path, to practice correct righteousness and interests as value orientation, to build a community of human destiny as a goal...with Chinese tradition The profound wisdom of culture, love and harmony, harmony and harmony, and the pursuit of Datong have transcended the traditional international relations theory based on zero-sum game and power politics, and answered the era proposition of "What is the world, what do we do?"</p>

         <p>“The way of benefit is to go with time.” The advanced concept of adapting to the trend of the times is bound to be widely recognized. From holding high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and win-win, to the "community of human destiny", "co-industry, co-construction, sharing" has been written into the UN resolution, and the Chinese philosophy of embracing the world and establishing people is increasingly attractive with its unique ideas. Deep into the hearts of the people, leading humanity to move forward on the road of peace and development.</p>

         <p>The diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics explains the grandeur of the Chinese pattern. In the past five years, President Xi Jinping has visited 28 times and has traveled to 56 countries on five continents. The Chinese head of state has achieved "full coverage" of different regions of the world. China has established or upgraded different forms of partnership with more than 70 countries and international organizations. The China Partnership Network has achieved “full coverage” of different types of countries and international organizations in the world, and China’s “friend circle” has expanded. From the periphery of the strategy, the development of the periphery, to actively managing the relationship between the major powers, deepening cooperation with developing countries, actively advocating multilateralism, going to the APEC leaders Beijing Conference, the G20 leaders Hangzhou Summit, the "Belt and Road" international cooperation The home-level diplomacy, such as the summit forum and the BRICS leaders’ meeting in Xiamen, and the full-scale diplomatic layout were in-depth.</p>

         <p>"Suddenly, the column is in the middle." In recent years, China and the rest of the world have joined forces to create a bridge of cooperation and win-win for the prosperity and development of mankind in order to break the peace deficit, develop deficits and manage deficits. In the midst of the times, China has increasingly become the ballast stone of world peace and development, the power source of global economic development, and injected a strong positive energy for improving global governance.</p>

         <p>The diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics bears witness to the solidity of China. "Promise one thousand, it is better to implement one." The combination of knowing and doing, and making words must mark the distinctive characteristics of Chinese diplomacy. More than 100 countries and international organizations actively participated in the participation, and a large number of influential and iconic projects have successfully landed, bringing a real sense of gain to the people of all countries. This is the vitality of the “Belt and Road” construction; Change the "Paris Agreement", actively assist the countries concerned to deal with the Ebola epidemic, and promote the political settlement of hot issues in the international region. This is a major power to deal with global challenges; the cumulative number of peacekeeping military personnel has exceeded 35,000, which is to defend the world. Peaceful justice. "Tao Li does not speak, it is self-contained." Actively acting as a pragmatic action, expanding the development prospects, highlighting the responsibility of responsible big countries, and attracting more and more countries to build and share, and to stabilize on the sunny road of cooperation and win-win Zhiyuan.</p>

         <p>"The road to the avenue is also the world." The diplomacy of a big country with Chinese characteristics has always been based in China and has a world of mind. China and the rest of the world continue to work together to let the peace of fire pass from generation to generation, let the power of development continue, let the light of civilization shine, and will certainly create a new realm of world peace and development, and move towards the community of human destiny. future.</p>
