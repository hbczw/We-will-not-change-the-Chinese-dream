                            <p>The report of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China first proposed a comprehensive "completed" society. The difference between “construction” and “construction” is far-reaching.</p>
                            <p> The "well-off society" was a strategic concept put forward by Deng Xiaoping in planning the blueprint for China's economic and social development in the late 1970s and early 1980s. With the deepening of the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, its connotation and significance have been continuously enriched and developed. In the case of basically achieving a "well-off" at the end of the 20th century, the report of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly stated that "a well-off society should be built in an all-round way."</p>

                            <p>President Xi Jinping said that from now until 2002, it is the decisive period for building a well-off society in an all-round way. In accordance with the requirements of the 16th National Congress, the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we must closely follow the major contradictions in our society and coordinate the promotion of economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social construction, and ecological civilization. Implement the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education, the strategy of strengthening the country through talents, the strategy of innovation-driven development, the strategy of rural revitalization, the strategy of regional coordinated development, the strategy of sustainable development, the strategy of integration of military and civilian development, highlighting key points, complementing short-boards, strengths and weaknesses, especially resolutely It is a good to prevent and resolve major risks, precision poverty alleviation, and pollution prevention and control, so that the comprehensive well-off society can be recognized by the people and can withstand historical tests.</p>
