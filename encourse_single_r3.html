    <h6 class="title-h2">"One Belt, One Road" has achieved remarkable results in five years of construction.</h6>
    <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         <p>In May 2017, the success of the “One Belt, One Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum in Beijing marked the beginning of a new phase of “One Belt, One Road” initiative from concept to action, from planning to implementation.</p>

        <p>Breakwaters taken at the New Deepwater Terminal in Kuantan Port, Malaysia on April 28, 2018. In order to cooperate with the development of the Mazhong Guandan Industrial Park and provide excellent port logistics services for the project, Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group Co., Ltd., together with the Malaysian partners, accelerated the upgrade of Kuantan Port after joining the Kuantan Port. .</p>

        <p>Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited five Asian and African countries including the United Arab Emirates and Senegal. One of the important achievements was that China signed cooperation documents with the United Arab Emirates, Senegal and Rwanda to jointly build the “Belt and Road”. Five years ago, China proposed the “Belt and Road Initiative” initiative. In the past five years, the construction of the “Belt and Road” has gradually transformed from an idea to an action, from an initiative to a consensus, from a vision to a reality, with fruitful construction results and a far-reaching impact on the world structure.</p>

        <h6 class="title">1. The more the results are done</h6>

        <p>"The One Belt One Road" is the biggest highlight in the past five years. It has turned the initiative into a real action. 'One Belt, One Road' has become a brand, and people feel that if you don't understand the 'Belt and Road', you are out of date. Wang Yijun, director of the Institute of International Affairs of Renmin University of China, said in an interview with this reporter.</p>

        <p>Wang Yizhen divided the results of the “Belt and Road” in the past five years into five categories: top-level design, major projects, planning docking, interconnection, and corporate actions.</p>

        <p>In the first category, the top-level design was initially completed, and the four beams and eight columns were established. The “Belt and Road” entered the international discourse system and became an international keyword. In March 2016, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution S/2274, which included the promotion of the “Belt and Road Initiative” initiative. In November of that year, UN General Assembly Resolution A/71/9 was first written into the “Belt and Road Initiative”, welcoming economic cooperation initiatives such as “One Belt, One Road” and urged all parties to strengthen economic development in Afghanistan and the region through the “Belt and Road Initiative”. The international community is called upon to provide a safe and secure environment for the construction of the “Belt and Road”. The resolution was unanimously endorsed by 193 Member States and reflected the general support of the international community for advancing the “Belt and Road Initiative” initiative.</p>

        <p>The second category includes a large number of major projects such as the Inner Mongolia Railway and the Yawan Railway. For example, in terms of railways, overseas railways such as the Inner Mongolia Railway and the Yaji Railway have been built, and the construction of cross-border railways such as Zhonglao and Zhongtai has been promoted. The preliminary work of the China-Nepal Railway was initiated and a communication and cooperation mechanism between the government departments of both parties was established. On the highway side, the construction of major infrastructure projects such as the two major highways of the China-Brazil Economic Corridor and the Sino-Russian Heihe Highway Bridge will be started. In terms of shipping, it is involved in the construction and operation of 42 ports in 34 countries including Greece's Piraeus Port, Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port and Pakistan Gwadar Port.</p>

        <p>In the third category, docking with more than 90 countries, the next China-Africa summit and next year's summit forum should also have a blowout. For example, China and related countries have formulated the Greater Mekong Sub-regional Traffic Strategy 2030, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Railway Development Strategy (2030), the China-ASEAN Transport Cooperation Strategic Plan, and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Transportation Infrastructure Special Plan. And other strategic planning.</p>

        <p>Interconnection has achieved a number of results, and "Ren Du Ermai" has been opened. In the past five years, policy communication has continued to deepen, facilities and facilities have been continuously strengthened, trade has been continuously improved, capital finance has been continuously expanded, and people's hearts have been continuously promoted. For example, the data released by the Ministry of Transport of China shows that the “Belt and Road Initiative” has proposed a number of achievements in terms of transportation connectivity in the past five years. The “Central Europe Train” opened 9000 rows, the international road passenger and cargo transportation lines opened 356, increased 403 international routes, and achieved direct flights with 43 countries along the route, with about 4,500 direct flights per week.</p>

        <p>In the fifth category, a large number of enterprises took action, and e-commerce and humanities exchanges began to bear fruit. "One Belt, One Road" became a fragrant.</p>

        <h6 class="title">2. The popularity is getting more and more popular</h6>

        <p>Recently, the International Finance Forum (IFF) China Report 2018 published the world's first “Belt and Road” questionnaire survey results, consisting of 26 representative national and regional central bank survey recovery questionnaires, summed up the “Belt and Road” In the past five years since the construction, China has cooperated with bilateral and multilateral companies on the results, problems and experiences of cooperation on investment projects. The report shows that 63% of the central banks surveyed believe that the “Belt and Road” initiative is an extremely important and even a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and one of the most important global initiatives of the past 10 years.</p>

        <p>From a brand-new concept to a "hot word" on the international stage, the five years that the "Belt and Road" has passed are amazing.</p>

        <p>"In the beginning, the general reaction of the world was to be curious and wait-and-see. I think it is very interesting for China to propose such an ambitious initiative. However, slowly, the topic involving China cannot be separated from the 'Belt and Road'. The world is talking about it. In China, it is no longer an abstract talk, but a specific topic. In 2015, China released the "Vision and Action to Promote the Construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road." At that time, the world realized that China’s 'One Belt, One Road' is not empty talk, but has a vision and action. After that, more and more countries are taking a positive attitude towards 'One Belt, One Road,'” Wang Yizhen said.</p>

        <p>“The Belt and Road Initiative attracts different types of countries. Developing countries, less developed countries, countries that are disappointed with the West, the most prone to China’s neighboring countries, smaller countries, and developed countries including the UK. Because of their own development needs, they have shown great enthusiasm for the 'One Belt, One Road'." Wang Yizhen said.</p>

        <p>This enthusiasm is particularly prominent in the expansion of the AIIB. Recently, with the approval of Lebanon as the intent member at the third annual meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the total number of members of the AIIB has reached 87, and this value was at the beginning of the establishment of the AIIB at the end of 2015. There are only 57. A further review of the transcripts of the AIIB since its establishment two and a half years ago is not only the increase in the number of member states. Up to now, the AIIB has carried out 28 projects in 13 countries and has successively won the highest credit ratings of three international rating agencies. It can be said that the achievements of the AIIB are remarkable, and this powerful multilateral financial institution is promoting Regional economic development has made tremendous contributions.</p>

        <p>Moreover, more and more countries that have been hesitating to watch are eager to try. "The EU is seriously absent from China's 'One Belt, One Road' initiative, and France should play a leading role in it, establish a commercial reciprocal relationship with China, and then promote the EU to act." According to the French newspaper Le Figaro, recently, A French Senate entitled "For France, is the Belt and Road Initiative a simple economic label or a new world order?" The report of "," solemnly reminded. According to the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" report, Japanese companies have begun to step up their efforts to find business opportunities around China's "One Belt, One Road" wide-area economic circle. Australian Trade and Investment Minister Steven Chopbo recently said: “Australia and China have the common goal of improving regional infrastructure, and Australia is very welcome to contribute to the regional infrastructure of ‘Belt and Road.’”</p>

        <p>“It can be said that after five years, ‘Belt and Road’ has developed from concept stocks to blue chip stocks and crowdfunding stocks,” said Wang Yizhen.</p>

        <h6 class="title">3. The road is getting wider and wider</h6>

        <p>More than two thousand years ago, the ancestors smashed the road to the blue sky and crossed the grassland desert, opening up the land-based Silk Road of China Uni-Europe; the ancestors sailed and sailed through the waves, and swayed the maritime Silk Road connecting East and West. In the 21st century, under the initiative of China, the “Belt and Road” has a dazzling brilliance. The road is getting wider and wider.</p>

        <p>As Fu Mengyu, vice president of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, pointed out, the “Belt and Road” is China's largest public product to date for the international community and the most popular international cooperation initiative in the world.</p>

        <p>On June 7 this year, President Xi Jinping said in a meeting with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev: "In the past five years, the 'One Belt, One Road' initiative has received positive response from the international community. The 'One Belt, One Road' initiative has achieved positive results. The key lies in conforming to the trend of world peace and development and meeting the actual needs of development cooperation along the line."</p>

        <p>"In the past five years, 'One Belt, One Road' has achieved outstanding results, which stems from three reasons. First, this is a new concept. It is not to take the old road, not to take the evil path, the goal is to build a new international relationship and build a human destiny. Second, the world today is very disappointing to the West and full of hope for China. China’s 40 years of reform and opening up have made remarkable achievements, highlighting China’s attractiveness. Third, it is thanks to the strong leadership of the Chinese leadership. The diligence and wisdom of the Chinese people, the positive actions of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese, and the enthusiastic participation of many companies." Wang Yizhen said.</p>

        <p>Fu Mengxi pointed out that the development and development process in the past five years has enabled more and more countries to have a deeper understanding of the global significance of the “Belt and Road” construction: globalization challenges are one after another, and it is difficult for individual countries to be independent and unable to solve the problems facing the world. Difficulties, and more and more countries feel in the “Belt and Road” dividend, the “Belt and Road” construction will help solve the economic globalization dilemma and promote a more balanced, inclusive and sustainable development of the world economy.</p>

        <p>The world is full of confidence in the prospect of the “Belt and Road” initiative. The world's first “Belt and Road” questionnaire survey of the International Finance Forum (IFF) China Report 2018 shows that 92% of central banks expect that the “One Belt, One Road” initiative will support domestic economic growth in the next five years, most of which will support Respondents believe that it can drive annual growth by nearly 1 percentage point. 25% of respondents are more optimistic, and the expected annual growth will be between 2-4 percentage points.</p>

        <p>As the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Rashid Alimov, said, five years after the proposal, the “Belt and Road” initiative has become a worldwide initiative. China's "One Belt, One Road" initiative is truly promoted in a mutually beneficial and win-win manner. The "One Belt, One Road" initiative will have a great future.</p>
