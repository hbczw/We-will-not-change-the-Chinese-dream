							<h4>Four confidence</h4>
							<img src="images/culture/w1.jpg">
							<h5>Cultural self-confidence is "a more basic, broader, deeper self-confidence."</h5>
							<p>Culture is the soul of a country and a nation. Throughout the ages, all nations of the world have been invariably affected by the spiritual culture they have produced at various stages of historical development.
Xi Jinping pointed out: "History and reality have shown that a nation that has abandoned or betrayed its own history and culture is not only impossible to develop, but is also likely to stage a historical tragedy."
Today, we must carry out the great struggle, build great projects, advance great undertakings, and realize great dreams, all of which cannot be separated from the spiritual power stimulated by culture. To inherit and develop your own culture, we must first maintain a high level of confidence in our own cultural ideals and cultural values, and maintain a high level of confidence in our cultural vitality and creativity.
This is the deep meaning of Xi Jinping's topic of "cultural self-confidence".
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the whole party must strengthen its road self-confidence, theoretical self-confidence, and self-confidence, and put forward new requirements for the mental state of the entire party and the people of all nationalities.
The socialist road with Chinese characteristics, the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the spiritual source is the Chinese outstanding traditional culture bred in the development of civilization for more than 5,000 years, and the revolutionary culture and advanced socialist culture fostered in the great struggle of the party and the people. It accumulates the deepest spiritual pursuit of the Chinese nation and represents the unique spiritual identity of the Chinese nation. Xi Jinping stressed: "We must strengthen the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, self-confidence, theoretical self-confidence, and institutional self-confidence. In the end, we must adhere to cultural self-confidence."
In July 2016, at the celebration of the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping pointed out that “cultural self-confidence is a more basic, broader and deeper self-confidence”, emphasizing “to persist in not forgetting the initial heart and to move on, we must adhere to Chinese characteristics. The socialist road is self-confident, theoretically confident, institutionally confident, and culturally confident."
Xi Jinping put forward "four self-confidences", highlighting the status of "more basic, broader and deeper" cultural self-confidence, and injecting a more basic, deeper and more lasting force for continuously pushing forward the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

"Being humble and forgetting about the country" "The profit-making of the country, the blasphemy of the country, and the sorrow of the country", "the rich and the poor can not be sinister, the impoverished can not move, the mighty can not bend", the "good life, no one died since ancient times," Retaining the heart of the heart of the heart, "dedication, death and then" dedication.
Xi Jinping pointed out to party members and cadres not only once, but also the history of learning can be seen as success or failure, knowing what is wrong, knowing and replacing; learning poetry can be flying, high spirits, and human spirits; academic ethics can know shame, understand honor and disgrace, and distinguish between right and wrong.
Xi Jinping vigorously promotes the excellent traditional culture of China. The purpose is to strengthen self-confidence and realize the creative transformation and innovative development of Chinese culture under the new era conditions, so as to "open the way of life with the rules of the ancients."</p>

							<h4>Revolutionary</h4>
							<img src="images/culture/w3.jpg">
							<h5>"The light of ideals does not die, the light of faith does not die."</h5>
							<p>During the revolutionary era, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people wrote a glorious history with blood and sweat, and gave birth to a distinct and unique revolutionary culture.
The spirit of the Red Boat, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of Xibaipo... Xi Jinping has always attached great importance to the revolutionary culture. Whether in military inspections or local investigations, Xi Jinping repeatedly said that he must persist in using revolutionary traditions to cast souls and educate people, and vigorously promote the revolutionary spirit.
In the past five years, Xi Jinping has visited revolutionary holy places such as Xibaipo, Gutian, Yan'an, Zunyi and Jinggangshan, commemorating the revolutionary martyrs and repeatedly emphasizing the revolutionary spirit.
In June 2015, Xi Jinping inspected Guizhou. The first stop was Zunyi. He went straight to the Red Army Mountain Martyrs Cemetery to see him. At the meeting place of Zunyi Meeting, Xi Jinping said: "We want to give everyone a good talk and tell everyone how our party came."
In July 2016, Xi Jinping came to Ningxia for an inspection, and the special plane flew directly to Guyuan. He drove more than an hour to the Fortress in Xiji County, and gave a rain basket to the Red Army Long March Memorial Monument.
......
In September 2016, Xi Jinping emphasized during the theme exhibition marking the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Long March. "Now, the times have changed, the conditions have changed, and the ideals and careers that our Communists have struggled for have not changed."
"The light of ideals is not destroyed, and the light of faith is not extinguished." Xi Jinping vigorously advocates revolutionary culture, that is, to make the Communists firmly believe in their ideals and convictions, not to be proud and not eager when they are victorious and good times, not to be unsettled in difficulties and adversity, and to take the long march of our generation.</p>

								<h4>Cultural soul</h4>
								<img src="images/culture/w4.jpg">
								<h5>"The cultural movements are in line with the national movement, and the context is connected with the national pulse."</h5>
								<p>Thoughts and values are the soul of culture. The core values of socialism are the concentrated expression of the contemporary Chinese spirit and the ideological and moral foundation that unites Chinese power.
The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to advocate prosperity, democracy, civilization and harmony, advocate freedom, equality, justice, and the rule of law, advocate patriotism, dedication, integrity, and friendliness, and actively cultivate and practice the core values of socialism.
Xi Jinping pointed out that prosperity, democracy, civilization and harmony are the values of the national level. Freedom, equality, justice and the rule of law are the values of society. The values of patriotism, dedication, honesty and friendliness are the values of the citizen level. This summary actually answers the major questions of what kind of country we want to build, what kind of society to build, and what kind of citizenship to cultivate.
Therefore, in the main theme of building a magnificent era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, these 24 words are the concentrated expression of the advanced socialist culture.
Xi Jinping emphasized: "The cultural movements are in line with the national movement, and the context is connected with the national pulse."
In the past five years, Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized the work of literature and art. In October 2014, Xi Jinping hosted a symposium on literary and art work and exchanged views with comrades in the literary and art circles to further clarify the direction and tasks of prospering and developing socialist literature and art under the new situation. In November 2016, Xi Jinping also attended the opening ceremony of the China National Literary Federation's Top Ten and the Chinese Writers' Association and delivered an important speech.
Xi Jinping pointed out that the literary and artistic achievements of any era can only be issued with a vibrating voice if they are closely maintained and shared with the country and the nation. It is time to change, take advantage of the trend, and change at any time. Resonance with the times is the law of literature and art. Leaving the fiery social practice, standing outside the main theme of the grand era, muttering to himself, can only be eliminated by the times.
Xi Jinping called on the vast number of literary and art workers to take the cultivation and promotion of the core values of socialism as their fundamental task, and unswervingly use the unique thoughts, emotions and aesthetics of the Chinese to create outstanding works of this era and with distinctive Chinese style.
Only such works can reflect the voice of the times, show the people's struggle, inspire the national spirit, cultivate noble sentiments, show a brighter future for our people, and paint a brighter future for our nation.</p>

                                        <p>Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping has mentioned cultural self-confidence on many occasions. Cultural self-confidence is, in the final analysis, a confidence in the Chinese traditional culture, the spiritual home of the Chinese nation. The Chinese culture has a long history and accumulates the deepest spiritual pursuit of the Chinese nation. It represents the unique spiritual identity of the Chinese nation and provides a rich nourishment for the Chinese nation to survive and develop. Don't forget this to open up the future, and be good at inheriting to be better innovating. China has been a multi-ethnic country since ancient times. Although there are contradictions and conflicts in various ethnic groups in history, it is the mainstream of ethnic relations to live in harmony, friendly exchanges and mutual learning, and jointly create a splendid Chinese civilization. With the difficulties of China’s peaceful rise and the development of the West after the reform and opening up, many Western countries now explore the Chinese traditional culture in terms of benevolence, nationalism, integrity, respect for justice, harmony, and equal thinking. The value of the times, the emergence of "Chinese culture fever", "Confucius fever" and "Chinese fever", is very worthy of national consideration. We should strengthen our cultural self-confidence and make new achievements in helping Guangxi's cultural prosperity and development.</p>
