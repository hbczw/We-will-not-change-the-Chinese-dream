            <h6 class="title-h2">"One Belt, One Road" cooperation and win-win construction to the ASEAN "sea bridge"</h6>
            <p></p>
            <div class="content-desc">
                 <p>Guangxi is located in the junction of the South China Economic Circle, the Southwest Economic Circle and the ASEAN Economic Circle. It is connected to the ASEAN countries, and the Beibu Gulf Port has a unique geographical advantage in the construction of the “Belt and Road”. Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group (hereinafter referred to as “Beigang Group”), based on Beibu Gulf Port, accelerates the maritime interconnection of ASEAN ports and fully integrates to build a China-ASEAN port city cooperation network.。</p>
                  <p></p>

                <p>At the end of March 2015, Peng Qinghua, secretary of the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region and director of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of the Autonomous Region, visited Brunei and jointly decided to cooperate with Brunei as the first key project of the Brunei-Guangxi Economic Corridor. . In September 2015, representatives of Brunei and Beigang Group signed a cooperation intention in Nanning.</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>The joint venture between Beigang Group and Brunei Darussalam Asset Management Company took over the management of Mora Port in February 2017. Beigang Group has fully utilized its experience in port planning, construction, operation and port-based industries. In a short period of time, it has upgraded the Port of Mora and improved port throughput efficiency. Mora Port has a traditional loading and unloading port to a modern integrated logistics port. upgrade. In combination with the concept and platform of Freeport (free trade zone), we will work hard to build the Mora Port Lingang Industrial Park, develop and construct the Big Mora Island Free Trade Zone, enhance the international transit container throughput of the Mora Port, and promote the Lingang processing industry and tourism. The development of industries and other industries has improved the level of maritime logistics and transportation facilitation in the Port of Mora, making the Port of Mora a regional container distribution center in Southeast Asia, and gradually becoming a regional hub port with modernization, specialization and large-scale. The operation of Brunei Mora Port is another achievement of the “Belt and Road” construction after the Beigang Group invested in Kuantan Port of Malaysia, marking the smooth landing of the flagship project of the Brunei-Guangxi Economic Corridor.</p>
                <p></p>

                <h6 class="title">1. Mora Harbour located in the “Golden Kingdom”</h6>
                <p></p>

                <p>Brunei has the reputation of “Golden Kingdom”. On February 21, 2017, Beigang Group and Brunei Darussalam Asset Management Company formed a joint venture company, Brunei Mora Port Co., Ltd., which officially took over the operation of the container terminal of Brunei Mora Port.</p>
                <p></p>

                <p>Located in Brunei Mora County, the Port of Mora is the only deep-water port in the country and the main channel for Brunei's international trade. Currently, 90% of the import and export goods of Brunei except the oil and gas resources pass through the port of Mora. However, due to the backward long-term operation and management technology, the port location advantage has not been effectively reflected. In addition, the logistics cost is high and the development of the Port of Mora is restricted. After the completion of the takeover work, Mora Port Co., Ltd. vigorously carried out the operation and management of the port and the subsequent upgrading and transformation. According to the requirements of “first-class facilities, first-class technology, first-class management and first-class service”, the Port of Mora was made “more It is a regional hub port that is smart, more modern, more environmentally friendly and more international.</p>

                　<p>At the same time, Mora Port introduced the "Hong Kong-Production-Garden" coordinated development model, in line with Brunei's unique free trade zone policy, Beigang Group further promoted the diversified development of Brunei's industrial structure and helped the rapid development of Brunei's economy.</p>

            　　<h6 class="title">2. Difficult to attack and build a modern port</h6>

            　　 <p>After taking over the container terminal at Mora Port, Beigang Group will comprehensively improve the comprehensive operational capacity of the terminal.</p>

            　　 <p>In March 2017, Beigang Group dispatched mechanical and technical experts to Mora Port for technical support, conducted surprise repairs on the old bridges and backyard equipment, and guided the maintenance of equipment, using only a few days. That is to say, the maintenance plan of the shore bridge was completed, and the bottleneck of only one shore bridge operation in the original port was broken in a short time, which greatly improved the ship operation capacity.</p>

            　　 <p>In August 2017, after taking over the container terminal of Mora Port for just 5 months, the newly added mobile equipments such as 4 front hoists and 3 stackers were officially put into use. For the last 20 years, there were no newly purchased equipments. The port has injected fresh blood.</p>

            　 <p>For a long time, the terminal operation and statistics of Mora Port are mainly based on the original manual record and then input into the computer. The statistics often have inaccuracies, and the situation of the terminal cannot be updated in real time. In response to this shortcoming, with the initiative and comprehensive support of the Beigang Group, the informationization construction of the Port of Mora has taken a milestone. In July 2017, Mora Port completed the online work of the port financial system, breaking the original manual bookkeeping mode of the original port. At present, the port operating system tailored for the Port of Mora has entered the final testing stage. In order to ensure the smooth operation of the system, Beigang Group dispatched technical experts to conduct core business training and guidance for employees in Mora Port. It is planned to complete the online work at the end of January 2018 to realize comprehensive information management of the port. The operational efficiency and accuracy of the terminal are expected. Got further improvement.</p>

            　　 <p>In terms of management, according to local conditions, the relevant management system was improved, the advanced management methods of Beibu Gulf Port were introduced, and a series of incentive measures were introduced to encourage employees to improve work efficiency.</p>

            　　 <p>In terms of services, the introduction of the "customer first" service concept of Beibu Gulf Port broke the situation that there was no customer service department in Mora Port. A customer service team was set up to develop a series of regular visit mechanisms, suggestions and complaint handling mechanisms to improve the quality of port services. The measures are arranged to arrange for special personnel to record and follow up the customer's demands to ensure the service level of the port. This series of measures has been widely praised by local governments, cargo owners and logistics providers.</p>

            　　<h6 class="title">3. Fighting for the day, building results</h6>

            　　 <p>After taking over the container terminal at Mora Port, after one year of hard work, the average operating efficiency of the single vessel at the port was 28.9 move/hour, up 44.5% year-on-year, and the average time for the outer trailer returning cabinet was 25 minutes, a decrease of 58.3% year-on-year.</p>

            　　 <p>According to the efficiency report of the Southeast Asian regional shipping company MCC, the efficiency of the Port of Brunei has exceeded that of Bintulu Port since July 2017, becoming the first port of efficiency in East Malaysia and Brunei; and since July, at MCC The KPI scoring system scored 5 points out of a row for 4 consecutive months. This is a result that the ports of East Malaysia and Brunei have never had before, and it is also a new historical record of Mora Port.</p>

            　　 <p>During the 2017 China-ASEAN Expo, the Sultan Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah visited the exhibition hall in Port Venezuela and heard about the operation of the joint venture company to take over the container port of Mora Port for half a year and about Moura. Haji Hassanal Bolkiah expressed his satisfaction with the operation of the container terminal at Mora Port in the introduction of the systematic construction and planning of the Hong Kong New Port Area and the supporting industrial park.</p>

            　　 <p>On September 15, 2017, Beigang Group and the relevant departments of the Brunei government signed the Brunei Mora Port Capital Injection Agreement, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Development and Construction of Brunei Logistics Park, and the Letter of Intent for the Development of Brunei Industrial Park, on the basis of further strengthening the overall operation management. The Chinese bilateral has taken a solid step in the development of diversified logistics services and the exploration of the “port-industry-park” collaborative development model that is in line with the common interests of both Chinese.</p>

            　　 <p>In the Golden Jubilee ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the Sultan’s reliance on the Sultan, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah specifically mentioned Brunei Mora Port Co., Ltd., his contribution to the company and his achievements. Fully affirmed, full of expectations for the company's future development.</p>

            　　<h6 class="title">4. Rely on projects to strengthen technical and cultural exchanges</h6>

            　　 <p>Brunei's special technical talents are in short supply, especially for large-scale mechanical driving. In order to help the local people to cultivate more talents, Beigang Group carried out front-mounted driving training for some of the excellent trailer drivers in Mora Port, and helped the employees to obtain the driving qualification certificates for the frontal cranes in the form of “pairing the pair of helpers”. In the next step, Beigang Group will further strengthen the training of local employees and continue to deliver more such port professionals to Brunei.</p>

            　　 <p>As more and more Chinese companies go abroad, Chinese is gradually becoming more popular in more countries. The Beigang Group organizes Brunei employees to conduct Chinese training to help local employees better understand Chinese culture. At the same time, Beigang Group also actively integrated into the local culture and actively participated in customs activities such as Ramadan, Brunei Sultan's birthday and the 50th anniversary of the throne, and cleared up the obstacles of “unacceptable water and soil”. In order to encourage more communication and exchanges between the two countries, the Beigang Group sent local Brunei employees to study in Beibu Gulf Port to master more advanced management concepts and technologies.</p>

            　　<h6 class="title">5. Looking forward to the future, the two sides have broad prospects for cooperation.</h6>

            　　 <p>While steadily operating the port, as the cooperation between China and Brunei continues to deepen, Beigang Group will further expand its investment in Brunei. The three agreements signed by the Beigang Group and Brunei partners, such as the Mora Port Capital Injection Agreement, the Logistics Park Development and Construction Memorandum of Understanding and the Industrial Park Development Letter of Intent, will gradually fall.</p>

            　　 <p>The first is to promote the upgrading of the terminal. In 2018, a new container berth will be expanded to increase the container terminal throughput capacity to 1 million TEU/year. At the same time, the existing general terminal will be upgraded and new shore loading and unloading equipment will be added to maximize port operation efficiency. Second, the Beigang Group will work with the Brunei government to start the development of the port supporting industrial park as soon as possible. At present, the development land of the industrial park has been basically clear. The development of the park will draw on the development model of the “Hong Kong-Product-Garden” development of the Kuantan Industrial Park in Malaysia, with the four major industries of “Halal Manufacturing”, electronic information, modern logistics and real estate as the leading direction. It also extends the R&D design, financial services, business services, business office and other supporting industries, forming four functional groups, namely, manufacturing R&D area, international logistics area, modern business district and ecological residential area, and has become a benchmark park for the development of Brunei industry.</p>

            　　 <p>The "front port and back garden"-style port-oriented industrial cluster will form a characteristic industrial chain gathering area. At the same time, it exerts the geographical advantages and regional development characteristics of Brunei in ASEAN, vigorously promotes the development of modern service industry, and gradually builds Brunei into the international business hub and international tourism service center of Kalimantan.</p>
