    <h6 class="title-h2">"One Belt, One Road, Cooperation and Win-Win" set up, small and medium-sized enterprises can also sing big dramas</h6>
    <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         <p>The first Southwest China SMEs “Belt and Road” summit forum was held in Nanning, Guangxi on April 30th. Representatives from more than 700 SMEs in Southwest China gathered in Yucheng to discuss business opportunities and challenges in the context of the “Belt and Road” and jointly witnessed the establishment of the “Belt and Road” entrepreneurship alliance for small and medium-sized enterprises in Southwest China.</p>

         <p>As Mr. Lu Xun said, there is no way in the world, and more people will become the way. China, as a large developing country, is proposing the “One Belt, One Road” initiative for its responsibility and responsibility in view of the slow recovery, development and differentiation of the world economy, profound changes in the international and regional situations, and the new situation and new tasks facing China’s development. This initiative, over the past three years, has received positive response and support from more than 100 countries and international organizations. It can be said that the “Belt and Road” has become the new road for China to lead the world in new development. In recent years, the construction of the “Belt and Road” has been advancing in exploration, perfecting in development, and growing in cooperation. The results far exceeded expectations. According to the latest data from the Ministry of Commerce, in the first quarter of this year alone, the import and export value of China and the countries along the “Belt and Road” accounted for nearly 30% of the total national total.</p>

         <p>Behind the high-growth data is a vast market and unlimited business opportunities, and the market and business opportunities bring about the development opportunities of enterprises. With the establishment of the New Asia-Europe Continental Bridge, China-Mongolia-Russia, China-Central Asia-West Asia, China-Indochina Peninsula and other international economic cooperation corridors, the construction of China-Pakistan, Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar economic corridors, etc., has allowed Chinese companies to The Belt and Road Initiative has become a real beneficiary. In Guangxi, one of the sources of the “Belt and Road”, as of February 2016, more than one-third of state-owned enterprises in Guangxi have launched overseas investment or foreign cooperation, and there are cooperation projects in 18 countries and regions. Distribution agencies are established in several countries.</p>

         <p>In addition, Guangxi private enterprises also actively participated in the construction of the “Belt and Road”. At present, there are 248 overseas investment private enterprises in the nuclear preparation case, and the Chinese agreement investment exceeds 2.275 billion US dollars. According to a survey conducted by the Autonomous Region Federation of Industry and Commerce, Guangxi private enterprises have investments in Asia, North America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, and South America, covering 46 countries and regions. Among them, the number of projects in the countries along the “Belt and Road” accounted for 83.6%. Some small and medium-sized enterprises use border trade advantages, set up border processing enterprises, and border enterprises to promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in Guangxi, especially to expand market access, expand the opening of high-end manufacturing and service industries, and promote Guangxi's economy and Guangxi's foreign trade. The transformation and upgrading highlights the magical charm of Guangxi “making the right seeds bloom in a suitable environment”.</p>

         <p>The construction of “One Belt, One Road” is a road to cooperation and win-win that promotes the complementary advantages of China and the countries along the line and achieves common prosperity and development. With the advancement of the “One Belt, One Road” national strategy, it has brought opportunities for the development of Chinese enterprises, especially to the outward development. As a small and medium-sized enterprise, how to ride the “Belt and Road” development specialization has drawn wide attention to the world. The “One Belt, One Road” Summit Forum for Southwest SMEs held in Nanning, Guangxi, has undoubtedly built a “going out” platform for many small and medium-sized enterprises. How to fully grasp the construction opportunities of the “Belt and Road” and win the golden pots in the win-win cooperation and shared development is indeed worthy of serious consideration.</p>

         <p>Now that the government has set up a platform, as a company, it should also enter the role as soon as possible. Enterprises must not only play the role of building the main force of the “Belt and Road”, but also become the most active force in construction and development. This requires that it must have a keen sense of domestic and international market, firmly focus on regional development opportunities, hard work, enhance the flexibility of transformation and transformation, enhance the ability of innovation and creativity, and constantly tap the potential of cooperation and development. Of course, all of this requires enterprises to break through their own internal reforms, improve the development mechanism, consciously complete the docking with international standards and standards, and focus on expanding projects and scales in international capacity cooperation, industrial park cooperation, and cross-border economic cooperation. Only in this way can we share the dividends brought about by the national strategy of “One Belt, One Road” in “going out and introducing”.</p>
