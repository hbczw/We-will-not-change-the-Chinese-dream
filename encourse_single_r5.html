    <h6 class="title-h2">China's economy welcomes new "opportunities" and cooperates with the world to achieve win-win cooperation</h6>
   <p></p>
    <div class="content-desc">
         
        <p>“I am very optimistic about the development of the Chinese market and the opportunities that have brought us.” For nearly 20 years with China, Volvo (China) Investment Co., Ltd. President Klaus always likes to mention two words – “worth” and “fun”. .</p>

         <p>In the 60-year-old Klaus, it is worthwhile because Volvo is deeply plunged into China and undoubtedly has a huge return; interesting, because of the changes in the Chinese economy, it has opened up more market potential for Volvo. At present, China has become the first domestic market outside the Swedish headquarters of Volvo to own all the businesses of the group.</p>

         <p>Volvo is just a microcosm. In fact, the willingness to grow with the Chinese economy has become the common aspiration of many foreign companies. The longer they deal with China, the stronger their voice.</p>

         <p>From January to June this year, the actual investment sources of the United States, Singapore, South Korea and the United Kingdom, which were the main sources of investment, increased by 29.1%, 19.7%, 43.8% and 82.5% respectively. The actual amount of foreign investment invested by ASEAN increased by 24.4% year-on-year, and the countries along the “Belt and Road” increased by 24.9% year-on-year.</p>

         <p>“Capital has always voted with its feet.” Zhang Yansheng, chief researcher of China International Economic Exchange Center, said that where there are many opportunities, fewer obstacles, high efficiency, and good service, where is the hot spot for investment, China is clearly a “quality stock”.</p>

        <h6 class="title">1. Seeking greater win-win with the world</h6>

         <p>On July 16, Beijing, a joint statement of the 20th China-EU Leaders' Meeting of nearly 10,000 words received much attention.</p>

         <p>"The two sides regard the ongoing "China-Europe Investment Agreement" negotiations as the top priority." "The two sides will continue to promote China's 'One Belt, One Road' initiative and the EU initiative." "The two sides are firmly committed to building an open world economy and improving trade and investment liberalization and convenience. ""</p>

         <p>China and the EU issued a pragmatic voice of cooperation and win-win, bringing a "warm flow" to the global economic recovery. Not only with Europe, this year, as a staunch supporter and contributor to globalization, China is committed to sharing development opportunities with countries and regions.</p>

         <p>From infant products to daily necessities, from consumer upgrades to anti-cancer drugs and other commodities urgently needed by the people, a series of imported goods have significantly reduced tariffs, providing more room for global competitive enterprises.</p>

         <p>Relax market access. Allow qualified foreign investors to come to China to operate insurance agents and other businesses; liberalize the business scope of foreign insurance brokerage companies; in the automotive sector, through the five-year transition period, the auto industry will cancel all foreign-investment ratio restrictions.</p>

         <p>Strengthen intellectual property protection. Re-establish the State Intellectual Property Office to create a business environment for domestic and foreign enterprises that is equally treated, equally protected, stable and transparent, and predictable.</p>

         <p>On July 11 and 13, the WTO conducted a seventh trade policy review of China in Geneva, and the review was a complete success. "China is an active participant in all aspects of the WTO." WTO Director-General Azevedo said that since China joined the WTO in 2001, China's role in the WTO has been increasing.</p>

        <h6 class="title">2. Deepen reform, expand and open up, and take the road ahead</h6>

         <p>The service desk seats are equipped with soft cushions, free tea coffee in the lounge area, service staff to explain patience and professionalism... In the summer season, in the comprehensive service hall of Kaifeng District of Henan Free Trade Zone, it is like walking into a “high-end cafe” ".</p>

         <p>"We not only need to achieve multi-certification to let the company do things, but also to work hard on the details of the service, so that the company can do things comfortably." Li Hongquan, deputy director of the district management committee, told reporters that we refer to the World Bank's business evaluation index system. To deepen its own reforms and get out of the way. Since its listing in April last year, as of the end of June this year, 3,360 enterprises have settled in the district, with a registered capital of more than 7 billion yuan, 18 times before the listing. A group of precision medical and IoT enterprises have settled in Kaifeng.</p>

         <p>“Kaifeng is famous for its ancient times. Now it is necessary to focus on new colors.” Kaifeng Mayor Gao Jianjun said that on the road to high-quality development, we only dare to try and embrace openness. There is no excuse to wait and see. The more you look, the more backward you are.</p>

        <h6 class="title">3. A glimpse of the whole leopard</h6>

         <p>At present, the trend of world peace cooperation is rolling forward, and the trend of openness and integration is rolling forward, and the trend of revolutionary innovation is rolling forward. How to move with the trend of globalization? How to promote the construction of a community of human destiny? The answer given by China is incomparably clear: deepening reforms and expanding openness.</p>

         <p>In the first half of the year, as far as China's 11 free trade pilot zones were concerned, the number of newly established foreign-invested enterprises reached 4,281, and the actual use of foreign investment was 57.84 billion yuan, an increase of 32.6%. In June this year, the State Council issued the "Notice on Several Measures for Active and Effective Use of Foreign Capital to Promote High-Quality Economic Development", and proposed policies and measures for actively and effectively utilizing foreign capital from six aspects: deepening the reform of "distribution management" and improving the level of investment facilitation.</p>

         <p>Li Weiqiao, chief economist of the World Bank China Bureau, commented that China's recent initiatives to expand openness and improve the business environment have helped to eliminate concerns about investing in China and maintain a normal multilateral trading system.</p>

         <p>Standing on a new starting point, a China that deepens reform and expands its openness will surely go hand in hand with the world on the road of cooperation and win-win.</p>
